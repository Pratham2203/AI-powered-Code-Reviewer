```javascript function sum(a, b) { return a + b; } 
``` **Explanation:** * **`
function sum(a, b)`:** This defines a function named `sum` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. These arguments are placeholders for the numbers you want to add. * **`{ ... }`:** The curly braces enclose the body of the function, which contains the instructions to be executed. * **`return a + b;`:** This line performs the addition of `a` and `b` and then `return`s the result. The `return` statement is crucial; it sends the calculated sum back to the part of your code that called the `sum` function. **How to use it:** ```javascript let result = sum(5, 3); // Calls the function with a = 5 and b = 3 
// console.log(result); // Output: 8 let x = 10; let y = 20; let total = sum(x, y); // Calls the function with x and y console.log(total); // Output: 30 ``` **Key Improvements and Considerations:** * **Argument Names:** Using `a` and `b` are common, but using more descriptive names (like `num1` and `num2`, or even `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`) can make your code easier to understand, especially in larger projects. * **Error Handling (Optional):** You might want to add basic error handling to ensure that the inputs are actually numbers: ```javascript function sum(a, b) { if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') { return "Error: Both arguments must be numbers."; // Or throw an error } return a + b; } ``` * **Default Parameters (Optional):** If you want to provide default values for the arguments if they aren't provided when the function is called: ```javascript function sum(a = 0, b = 0) { return a + b; } console.log(sum()); // Output: 0 (both a and b default to 0) console.log(sum(5)); // Output: 5 (a is 5, b defaults to 0) console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8 ``` This improved version is a complete and well-defined function that you can use in your JavaScript code to add two numbers. Remember to choose argument names and potentially add error handling based on the specific requirements of your project.
